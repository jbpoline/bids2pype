From Chris:
I've analyzed my data a long while ago (ds114). The dictionaries for nipype are here: https://github.com/chrisfilo/2010-Reliability-Study/blob/51660a2b933d5e2912f266ce5aabe0c125a52e05/src/variables.py#L67, (the format is not exactly the same, but hopefully you can figure it out). Russ can comment on other datasets analyzed previously on TACC.

From Satra
our canned scripts are going to be uploaded here from now on:
https://github.com/gablab/openfmri
we are slowly moving over to all things BIDS and then eventually to all things NIDM. but we have had reasonable success with these things. one thing that's there is a basic group level model.
there is a qa script as well that is presently an interactive notebook, but hope to redo it in the next few months.
